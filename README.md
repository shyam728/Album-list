## Features

1. **Fetch and Show Albums:**
   - The app fetches albums from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums) and displays them.

2. **Add an Album:**
   - You can add a new album by making a POST call to the API. Note that this is a dummy request, and the data won't be saved on the server.

3. **Update an Album:**
   - You can update an existing album by making a PUT call to the API. This is also a dummy call.

4. **Delete an Album:**
   - You can delete an album by making a DELETE call to the API. Again, this is a dummy call.
